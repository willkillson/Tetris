# Tetris

All code by me can be found in Game.h

This project uses [the planet chili framework](https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework) for initializing OpenGL.

Seven segment counter can be found [here](https://github.com/willkillson/SevenSegmentDisplay) which also uses the framework.


Base tetris game was written in my first year of uni learning C (which is a mess), and can be found [here](https://github.com/willkillson/ASCIItetris).
